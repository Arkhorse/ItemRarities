# Rarities

Rarities are arbitrary properties given to all items; while it does not impact gameplay, they reflect an item's value, usefulness, or acquirement. To see the spreadsheet of items and their rarities, visit the [**Item Rarities Spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GYx75iHGRJ5AfWfUAXs2Kjo12n39vlJQqztVXXeLwZs/edit?usp=sharing).

## In-Game Rarities

When no rarity value is specified for an item in the game, the item will default to disabling the rarity label.
