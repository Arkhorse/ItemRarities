# Item Rarity Criteria

Welcome to the rarity criteria section for this modification. This document provides insights as to what factors determine the rarity of an item.

To see the list of items and their rarities, please refer to the [**Item Rarities Calculator Spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GUh8aYRBGjHIv6Q4XgQe_q5LnUdL6oR5PuvzfPH0rQ/edit?usp=sharing).

> **Note**: While these factors help determine the rarity of an item instead of just randomly choosing, the factors values are still opinion based.

## Criteria Outline

The rarity of an item is determined based on the following criteria:
1. [**Spawn Frequency**](#1-spawn-frequency)
2. [**Functionality**](#2-functionality)
3. [**Crafting**](#3-crafting)
4. [**Lore Significance**](#4-lore-significance)
5. [**Durability**](#5-durability)

### 1. Spawn Frequency

- **Common**
  - Items like sticks, stones, and reclaimed wood, which are found almost everywhere in the game.
