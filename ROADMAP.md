## v1.X.X (Upcoming Releases):

This release focuses on preparing for the next major milestones or small fixes.

 - Allow developers to give their own items a rarity.
	 - Possibly through an external `.json` file which I can ship with the mod.

## Planned But Unscheduled:

Planned content which doesn't have a set release version or date.

 - Create custom UILabel, instead of duplicating existing ones.
	 - This should allow much easier implementation.
	 - May eliminate any incompatibilities.
 - Ability to filter by rarity.

## Concept Ideas:

A bundle of ideas, with no guarantee of implementation.
